# Contributing to FraudxAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **FraudxAI**!

FraudxAI is an open-source research and engineering platform designed to simulate realistic payment card networks, adversarial dynamics, and causal ground-truth benchmarks for fraud detection.

## 1. The Core Mandate: Anti-Astronaut Grounding

All contributions must adhere strictly to the **Anti-Astronaut Grounding Mandate** codified in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md):

1. **Zero Theoretical Buzzwords:** Do not introduce speculative or non-implementable concepts unless backed by executable Python code.
2. **Physical & Financial Units:** Every parameter must have concrete physical or financial units (e.g., USD cents, INR paisa, seconds, km/h, probabilities in $[0.0, 1.0]$).
3. **Real-World Banking Plumbing:** Models must reflect actual payment rails: ISO 8583 response codes (`00` Approved, `05` Do Not Honor, `51` Insufficient Funds, `57` Transaction Not Permitted, `59` Suspected Fraud), AVS (Address Verification), CVV validation, 3DS 2.x exemption rules, and dual-message pre-auth holds vs. financial settlement.
4. **Specification-First Development:** All new scenarios or products must first be defined in `spec/` before writing implementation logic.
5. **Deterministic Verification:** Every behavioral claim must be proven via automated `pytest` assertions.

## 2. Development Setup

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhavyashah94/FraudxAI.git
cd FraudxAI
```

### Install in Editable Mode
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run the Test Suite
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
All 54 unit tests must pass before submitting a pull request.

### Run Operational Invariant Verification
```bash
python scripts/verify_grounded_invariants.py
```
All 37 grounded banking invariants must report `100% PASS RATE`.

### Run Forensic Realness Audit
```bash
python scripts/audit_fraud_realness.py
```

2. **Commit your changes** with descriptive commit messages.
3. **Ensure 100% test coverage** for any new features or bug fixes.
4. **Push to your fork** and submit a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
