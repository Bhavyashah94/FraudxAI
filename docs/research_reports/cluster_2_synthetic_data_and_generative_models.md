## Executive Summary

The synthesis of realistic financial data—encompassing high-dimensional tabular transaction records, continuous-time transaction streams, and limit-order books—stands at a critical methodological crossroads. On one side, proponents of **Deep Generative Models (DGMs)**—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN, TimeGAN, CTAB-GAN+) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (TabDDPM, STaSy)—argue that unconstrained deep neural networks can approximate arbitrary multivariate distributions $P(X_{1:D})$ without requiring hand-engineered domain heuristics or rigid rule-based systems. On the other side, proponents of **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)** and multi-agent systems (PaySim, BankSim, ABIDES, and FraudxAI) maintain that financial transactions are fundamentally discrete, stateful, protocol-governed events constrained by physical, mathematical, regulatory, and legal conservation laws.

This research report provides an exhaustive, balanced, and mathematically grounded comparative evaluation of these two paradigms. Through in-depth reviews of anchor literature—including **TabDDPM** (Kotelnikov et al., ICML 2023), **CTGAN** (Xu et al., NeurIPS 2019), **TimeGAN** (Yoon et al., NeurIPS 2019), **New Money: A Systematic Review** (Meldrum et al., 2025), and foundational causal frameworks (Schölkopf et al., 2021)—we systematically evaluate the theoretical claims and empirical strengths of generative modeling.

We then present a rigorous forensic counter-critique and the **FraudxAI architectural defense**: demonstrating that unconstrained generative models inevitably hallucinate semantically illegal, physically impossible, and regulatory non-compliant payment states. Specifically, DGMs systematically violate:
1. **ISO 8583 & 3DS Protocol Invariants:** Emitting contradictory transaction attributes (e.g., EMV chip entry modes lacking Bit 55 cryptograms; approved response codes on declined 3DS challenges);
2. **Conservation of Money & Multi-Party Solvency:** Creating or destroying currency out of thin air, violating double-entry bookkeeping, and permitting negative balances on non-overdraft accounts;
3. **Space-Time Kinematic Velocity Limits:** Emitting consecutive in-person card-present transactions exceeding the $900\text{ km/h}$ commercial aviation ceiling (often implying hypersonic travel speeds $> 20,000\text{ km/h}$);
4. **Asynchronous Temporal Dynamics:** Inability to capture heavy-tailed, self-exciting transaction bursts (brute-force carding, cash-out runs) that naturally obey Hawkes point processes rather than fixed-interval sequential models.

Finally, we detail how FraudxAI resolves this tension through a hybrid architecture: pairing expressive agent-based behavioral intent generation with a deterministic, institutional **Payment Rail Verifier Switch** ([`fraudx_synthesizer/rails.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/rails.py)), a strict double-entry core ledger ([`fraudx_synthesizer/ledger.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/ledger.py)), and an invariant verification engine ([`fraudx_synthesizer/invariants.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/invariants.py)).

## 2. In-Depth Reviews of Key Anchor Papers

### 2.1 TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models (Kotelnikov et al., ICML 2023)
*arXiv:2209.15421* | Stance: **Opposing**

        Xhat_t -->|"Reverse Steps"| Xhat_0["Synthesized Row x_syn"]
    end
```

#### Core Architecture & Mathematical Formulation
TabDDPM adapts Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to tabular records composed of heterogeneous feature vectors $x = [x_{\text{num}}, d_{\text{cat}}]$, where $x_{\text{num}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\text{num}}}$ represents continuous columns and $d_{\text{cat}} \in \{1, \dots, K_1\} \times \dots \times \{1, \dots, K_{N_{\text{cat}}}\}$ represents discrete columns.

1. **Continuous Feature Diffusion:** Continuous features follow standard Gaussian diffusion:
   $$q(x_{\text{num}, t} \mid x_{\text{num}, t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\left(x_{\text{num}, t}; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{\text{num}, t-1}, \beta_t I\right)$$
   where $\{\beta_t\}_{t=1}^T$ is a cosine or linear variance schedule. The reverse denoising step is parameterized by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with residual connections that predicts either the added noise $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$ or the clean vector $x_0$.

2. **Categorical Feature Diffusion (Multinomial Diffusion):** Rather than embedding categories into Euclidean space or one-hot approximations that break under continuous noise, TabDDPM uses discrete multinomial diffusion (Austin et al., 2021). The categorical variable $d_t$ transitions toward a uniform distribution over its $K$ states:
   $$q(d_t \mid d_{t-1}) = \text{Cat}\left(d_t; (1 - \beta_t) d_{t-1} + \beta_t \frac{1}{K}\mathbf{1}\right)$$
   The reverse model outputs logits over classes, trained via variational lower bound (VLB) cross-entropy loss.

#### Proponent Claims & Empirical Evidence
- **ML Efficacy Superiority:** Evaluated across 15 benchmark datasets (e.g., Adult, Covertype, Default, Insurance), TabDDPM achieves higher downstream machine learning efficacy (F1, ROC-AUC, RMSE) than CTGAN, TVAE, and SMOTE.
- **Mode Coverage & Likelihood Estimation:** Unlike GANs, which suffer from mode collapse on rare categories, TabDDPM's likelihood-based objective forces the model to distribute probability mass across all observed modes.
- **Privacy Trade-off:** The authors demonstrate that while shallow interpolators (SMOTE) achieve high ML utility, they heavily memorize training instances (high Distance to Closest Record, DCR). TabDDPM produces samples with greater Euclidean separation from training points, claiming superior privacy preservation.

### 2.2 CTGAN & TVAE: Modeling Tabular Data using Conditional GAN (Xu et al., NeurIPS 2019)

    ModeRep & ScalRep --> Discr["Discriminator D(r, m) with PacGAN"]
    Gen --> Discr
```

#### Core Architecture & Mathematical Formulation
Xu et al. identify two major pathologies that cause standard GANs to fail on tabular data:
1. **Multi-Modal Non-Gaussian Distributions:** Continuous attributes often have multiple modes with extreme variance disparities.
2. **Category Imbalance:** Rare discrete values are starved of gradient signal during standard min-max optimization.

To solve these, CTGAN introduces:
1. **Mode-Specific Normalization:** Each continuous column $C_i$ is fitted with a Variational Gaussian Mixture Model (VGM) with $K=10$ components:
   $$\mathbb{P}(c_{i,j}) = \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_{i,k} \mathcal{N}\left(c_{i,j}; \mu_{i,k}, \sigma_{i,k}^2\right)$$
   Each scalar $c_{i,j}$ is transformed into a composite vector $[\alpha_{i,j}, \beta_{i,j}]$, where $\beta_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\}^K$ is a one-hot representation of the most probable Gaussian mode, and $\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{c_{i,j} - \mu_{i,k}}{4\sigma_{i,k}}$ is the scalar value normalized within that specific mode.
2. **Conditional Generator & Training-by-Sampling:** To counter extreme class imbalance (e.g., fraud prevalence of $0.1\%$), CTGAN generates a conditioning vector $m = [m^{(1)}, \dots, m^{(N_{\text{cat}})}]$ specifying a target class for one chosen categorical column. During training, categories are sampled inversely proportional to their log-frequency, ensuring rare fraud transactions are presented to the generator with equal probability.
3. **TVAE (Tabular Variational Autoencoder):** Adapts the standard VAE ELBO objective to mixed-type data using cross-entropy for discrete columns and Gaussian negative log-likelihood for mode scalars $\alpha_{i,j}$.

#### Proponent Claims & Empirical Evidence
- Evaluated on 8 real-world and 7 synthetic datasets against Bayesian network baselines (CLBN, PrivBN) and early tabular GANs (MedGAN, TableGAN).
- CTGAN outperformed Bayesian baselines on 7 out of 8 datasets in ML efficacy, while TVAE demonstrated competitive log-likelihood fit.
- Proponents argue that by decoupling mode selection from continuous spread, CTGAN captures complex non-linear correlations between columns without domain-specific feature engineering.

        H -->|"Stepwise Supervised Loss"| Gen
    end
```

#### Core Architecture & Mathematical Formulation
Standard sequential GANs (such as RCGAN) train a generator $G: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathcal{X}$ purely against a discriminator $D: \mathcal{X} \to [0, 1]$. Yoon et al. demonstrate that this setup fails to preserve temporal dynamics because adversarial feedback alone cannot constrain the step-to-step transition probabilities $P(X_t \mid X_{1:t-1})$.

TimeGAN introduces a 4-network architecture operating across two spaces:
1. **Embedding Network ($e$) & Recovery Network ($r$):** Form an autoencoder mapping high-dimensional sequential observations $X \in \mathcal{X}$ to a lower-dimensional latent space $H \in \mathcal{H}$:
   $$h_t = e(h_{t-1}, x_t), \quad \tilde{x}_t = r(h_t)$$
   trained via reconstruction loss $\mathcal{L}_R = \mathbb{E}\left[\|x_t - \tilde{x}_t\|_2^2\right]$.
2. **Sequence Generator ($g$) & Sequence Discriminator ($d$):** The generator produces synthetic latent sequences $\hat{h}_t = g(\hat{h}_{t-1}, z_t)$ driven by an autoregressive recurrence.
3. **Stepwise Supervised Loss:** Crucially, TimeGAN introduces an explicit supervised loss:
   $$\mathcal{L}_S = \mathbb{E}_{X \sim p}\left[\sum_t \left\|h_t - g(h_{t-1}, z_t)\right\|_2^2\right]$$
   which forces the generator to approximate the conditional distribution $P(H_t \mid H_{1:t-1})$ directly from historical transitions.
4. **Joint Objective:** The complete loss combines adversarial loss $\mathcal{L}_U$, supervised loss $\mathcal{L}_S$, and reconstruction loss $\mathcal{L}_R$:
   $$\min_{e, r, g} \max_d \left(\mathcal{L}_U + \eta \mathcal{L}_S + \lambda \mathcal{L}_R\right)$$

#### Proponent Claims & Empirical Evidence
- Evaluated on financial time series (daily stock price and volume of S&P 500 components) and energy consumption.
- Demonstrates superior 2D t-SNE and PCA overlap, lower Discriminative Score (a post-hoc RNN distinguishing real from synthetic sequences), and lower Predictive Score (Train on Synthetic, Test on Real for next-step forecasting).
- Proponents assert that TimeGAN captures temporal autocorrelations, volatility clustering, and lead-lag dynamics without specifying parametric stochastic differential equations (e.g., GARCH or jump-diffusion).

### 2.4 New Money: A Systematic Review of Synthetic Data Generation for Finance (Meldrum et al., 2025)

pie title Generative Architectures in Financial Synthesis Literature (72 Studies)

    "VAE-Based (TVAE, CVAE)" : 22.2
    "Diffusion Models (TabDDPM, STaSy)" : 11.1
    "LLM & Transformers" : 5.6
    "Other Hybrid / Copula" : 2.8
```

#### Systematic Review Scope & Methodology
Meldrum et al. (2025) conduct an exhaustive systematic literature review analyzing 72 peer-reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025 on synthetic financial data generation. The review categorizes:
1. **Financial Modalities Synthesized:** Tabular credit/fraud data ($47\%$), time-series market pricing ($38\%$), order book data ($10\%$), and transaction graphs ($5\%$).
2. **Dominant Architectures:** GAN architectures represent $58.3\%$ of studies, VAEs represent $22.2\%$, while diffusion models represent the fastest-growing segment ($11.1\%$, concentrated in 2023–2025).
3. **Evaluation Practices:** Utility is overwhelmingly measured by marginal similarity metrics (Wasserstein distance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, correlation matrix Frobenius norm) and Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR).

#### Critical Findings & Unaddressed Gaps
1. **Severe Privacy Evaluation Deficit:** The authors discover that over $65\%$ of published studies perform **no quantitative privacy evaluation** whatsoever (omitting Membership Inference Attacks, Attribute Disclosure Attacks, and Differential Privacy proofs), despite citing "privacy preservation" as their primary raison d'être.
2. **Absence of Domain Invariant Enforcement:** Over $92\%$ of evaluated deep generative models do not enforce institutional domain constraints, regulatory rules, or balance-sheet conservation laws.
3. **The "Stylistic Realism" Illusion:** Models that score exceptionally well on marginal statistical distance tests (e.g., KS test $p > 0.05$) frequently fail basic financial consistency checks (e.g., generating negative asset prices, unhedged arbitrage opportunities, or inconsistent debit/credit balances).

### 2.5 ABIDES & Towards Causal Representation Learning (Byrd et al., 2019; Schölkopf et al., 2021)
*arXiv:1904.12066* & *arXiv:2102.11107* | Stance: **Supporting**

#### ABIDES: Agent-Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulation (Byrd et al., 2019)
- **Discrete-Event Kernel:** ABIDES implements a nanosecond-resolution discrete-event simulator for equity markets, explicitly modeling NASDAQ's ITCH and OUCH protocol messages.
- **Microstructure Mechanics:** Rather than sampling prices from a distribution, ABIDES simulates thousands of heterogeneous background agents (Value Agents, Momentum Agents, Noise Agents) and market-maker exchange agents. Every executed trade is the deterministic result of a matching engine processing limit orders.
- **Latency & Queue Dynamics:** Models pairwise network latencies between agents and the exchange, reproducing realistic order-book dynamics, flash crashes, and market impact curves that no static or Markovian generative model can replicate.

#### Towards Causal Representation Learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021)
- **The Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICM) Principle:** Real-world systems are governed by autonomous, invariant causal mechanisms that do not inform or influence one another.
- **The Failure of Observational DGMs:** Deep generative models approximate joint observational distributions $P(X)$. However, when an intervention occurs (e.g., a bank modifies its fraud threshold, or an adversarial syndicate shifts its attack vector), $P(X)$ changes non-trivially (the Lucas Critique).
- **Structural Invariance:** To generate valid counterfactuals and survive distribution shifts, a synthesizer must learn or enforce structural causal models (SCMs):
  $$X_i = f_i\left(\text{PA}_i, U_i\right)$$
  where interventions $do(X_j = x)$ alter only the target mechanism $f_j$, leaving downstream physical invariants intact.

## 3. Why Proponents Argue Deep Generative Models Outperform Rule-Based/DES Simulators

To maintain an objective, critical perspective, we examine the technical arguments and empirical merits advanced by proponents of CTGAN, TabDDPM, TimeGAN, and modern generative architectures.

### 3.1 Unconstrained Approximation of High-Dimensional Joint Distributions
In complex financial datasets with $D \ge 50$ continuous and categorical columns, the true joint distribution $P(X_1, \dots, X_D)$ exhibits complex dependencies, such as:
- Non-linear copulas and asymmetric tail dependencies (e.g., extreme market drawdowns coinciding with credit defaults);
- Non-Gaussian, multi-modal distributions across continuous features (e.g., bimodal transaction ticket sizes corresponding to low-value coffee purchases and high-value rent payments);
- High-cardinality categorical variables with severe power-law imbalances (e.g., thousands of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs), where the top 10 represent $80\%$ of volume, and rare fraud MCCs appear in $< 0.01\%$ of rows).

Proponents argue that rule-based systems (such as early iterations of PaySim or BankSim) rely on simplistic parametric assumptions (e.g., independent log-normal distributions for transaction amounts and uniform distributions for timestamps). Specifying the full joint covariance matrix across 50 heterogeneous features requires estimating $O(D^2)$ pairwise interactions and higher-order moments. In contrast, deep neural networks (via diffusion score matching or adversarial minimax games) theoretically serve as universal approximators, capturing arbitrary non-linear joint interactions directly from data without manual engineering.

### 3.2 Elimination of Expert Bias and Hand-Engineered Specification Drift
Handcrafted discrete-event simulators encode the explicit domain beliefs, cognitive biases, and limitations of their human designers. Proponents highlight several failure modes of manual rule engineering:
- **Heuristic Mis-Specification:** A human designer may specify that fraud occurs predominantly at night (e.g., 01:00 to 05:00). In reality, sophisticated fraud syndicates execute automated daytime attacks designed to blend into legitimate retail volume.
- **Dimensionality Bottlenecks:** While a human expert can write 50 or 100 conditional rules, they cannot anticipate the intricate 6-way interaction terms between `user_tenure`, `device_fingerprint_entropy`, `mcc`, `subminute_attempts`, `interchange_fee`, and `geo_velocity`.
- **Maintenance Burden:** Financial products, fraud attack patterns, and consumer shopping behaviors evolve continuously. A generative model can be retrained on new historical batches automatically via gradient descent, whereas rule-based simulators require continuous manual updates to hundreds of heuristic branching statements.

### 3.3 Formal Privacy Guarantees via Differential Privacy
When financial institutions share synthetic data with external vendors or academic researchers, they face strict regulatory penalties (GDPR Art. 9, CCPA, GLBA) if synthetic records can be linked back to real individuals. Deep generative models integrate seamlessly with formal differential privacy frameworks:
- **DP-SGD (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent):** By clipping per-sample gradients with threshold $C$ and injecting Gaussian noise $\sigma$:
  $$\tilde{g}_t = \frac{1}{B} \left(\sum_{i=1}^B \frac{g_i}{\max\left(1, \frac{\|g_i\|_2}{C}\right)} + \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2 C^2 I\right)\right)$$
  models like DP-CTGAN and PATE-GAN provide rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantees.
- In contrast, rule-based simulators that calibrate agent parameters directly against small empirical cohorts (e.g., setting agent spend limits to match high-net-worth client profiles) lack formal mathematical bounds against attribute disclosure or reconstruction attacks.

### 3.4 High Machine Learning Efficacy (Train on Synthetic, Test on Real)
Proponents evaluate generative models primarily on **TSTR (Train on Synthetic, Test on Real)** benchmarks. If a gradient boosted decision tree (XGBoost, LightGBM) trained exclusively on synthetic data achieves ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores within $1\text{–}3\%$ of a model trained on real production data, proponents conclude the generative model has captured the essential decision boundary. In Kotelnikov et al. (2023), TabDDPM demonstrated TSTR performance virtually indistinguishable from real data across multiple Kaggle and UCI benchmarks, leading proponents to declare tabular diffusion a solved problem.

## 4. Rigorous Counter-Critique & FraudxAI Architectural Defense

Despite the mathematical elegance of deep generative models, deploying unconstrained GANs, VAEs, or Diffusion models for financial transaction synthesis produces catastrophic failures. Below is the technical forensic analysis of why unconstrained DGMs hallucinate impossible states, and how FraudxAI's architecture enforces domain realism.

### 4.1 Hallucination of Impossible Payment States & ISO 8583 Protocol Non-Compliance

Financial transactions are not unconstrained vectors in $\mathbb{R}^D$; they are serialized instances of rigorous international banking protocols (ISO 8583 and ISO 20022) governed by stateful terminal hardware and network switches.

#### The Failure of CTGAN and TabDDPM
Because DGMs treat tabular columns as conditionally independent given latent vectors or denoised diffusion representations, they assign positive probability density to semantically illegal combinations:
1. **EMV Chip & Cryptogram Incoherence:** A diffusion model will emit a record with `channel_type = "CP_POS_CHIP"` (POS Entry Mode `051`) but set `emv_cryptogram_valid = False` or omit Bit 55 Application Cryptograms (ARQC) while simultaneously asserting `iso_response_code = "00"` (Approved). In physical terminal specifications (EMV 4.3 Book 2), an issuer host switch will immediately reject any chip transaction lacking a valid cryptogram with Response Code `63` (Security Violation) or `59` (Suspected Fraud).
2. **Contactless Velocity & Regulatory Ceilings:** In India, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations strictly cap contactless PIN-free transactions at ₹5,000, enforcing a mandatory step-up to EMV chip+PIN above this ceiling, with an absolute daily limit of 5 consecutive contactless transactions. CTGAN routinely generates contactless NFC transactions of ₹45,000 with `pin_entered = False` and `approved = True`, creating a legally and operationally impossible banking event.
3. **3DS 2.x State Machine Incoherence:** A generated row may specify `channel_type = "CNP_WEB"`, `trans_status_3ds = "N"` (Authentication Rejected by Access Control Server), yet emit `approved = True` and `iso_response_code = "00"`. Under Visa 3DS 2.2 Core Specifications, an issuer cannot authorize an e-commerce transaction that failed 3DS authentication without a catastrophic liability shift.

#### FraudxAI Architectural Defense: The Deterministic Rail Verifier Switch
FraudxAI prevents these hallucinations by establishing an unyielding **Boundary Layer 1: Deterministic Rail Verifier Switch** ([`fraudx_synthesizer/rails.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/rails.py)):
- **Decoupled Candidate Intent Contract:** Generative models or agents do not generate finalized transaction records directly. Instead, they propose a `CandidateTransactionIntent`:
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class CandidateTransactionIntent:
      tx_id: str
      card_id: str
      sim_time_sec: float
      amount: float
      currency: str
      channel_type: str
      merchant_id: str
      mcc: int
      merchant_lat: float
      merchant_lon: float
      # Proposed credentials
      otp_submitted: bool = True
      pin_entered: bool = False
      emv_chip_present: bool = False
      emv_cryptogram_valid: bool = True
  ```
- **Stateful Institutional Switch Evaluation:** The intent is processed by `RailVerifierSwitch.verify_intent()`, which evaluates regulatory velocity ceilings, 3DS 2.x exemption state machines (Low-Value, TRA, Whitelist), EMV cryptogram validity, and CVV2/AVS matching, generating exact ISO 8583 response codes (`00` Approved, `05` Do Not Honor, `51` Insufficient Funds, `59` Suspected Fraud, `63` Security Violation, `65` Exceeds Frequency Limit).

---

### 4.2 Violation of Fundamental Conservation Laws (Conservation of Money & Solvency Accounting)

A cornerstone of financial reality is the principle of conservation of value: money cannot be created or destroyed out of thin air, and account balances must follow double-entry arithmetic.

#### The Failure of Unconstrained Generative Models
In statistical tabular models (CTGAN, TabDDPM), `amount`, `old_balance`, and `new_balance` are modeled as separate continuous columns. Consequently:
- **Balance Discrepancy Hallucination:** The model samples `amount = 150.00`, `old_balance_orig = 1000.00`, and `new_balance_orig = 920.00` (an unexplained variance of $70.00). This exact arithmetic violation plagues the widely used PaySim dataset, creating trivial, unrealistic shortcuts for naive fraud models.
- **Unbounded Negative Balances:** When synthesizing series of transactions for a specific account, DGMs have no concept of credit limits or posted balances. A cardholder with a $1,000 credit limit can be sampled for ten consecutive $800 transactions, driving their balance to $8,000 without triggering decline code `51` (Insufficient Funds).

#### FraudxAI Architectural Defense: Stateful Multi-Party Core Ledger
FraudxAI enforces strict mathematical conservation through its **Stateful Core Ledger** ([`fraudx_synthesizer/ledger.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/ledger.py)):
- **Double-Entry Balance Updates:** Every transaction executes atomic double-entry updates:
  $$\Delta \text{Balance}_{\text{payer}} + \Delta \text{Balance}_{\text{payee}} + \text{Interchange Fee} + \text{Network Fee} = 0$$
- **Solvency Guardrails:** Before an authorization is granted, the Rail Switch verifies:
  $$\text{Posted Balance} + \text{Pending Holds} + \text{Amount} \le \text{Credit Limit} + \text{Overdraft Buffer}$$
  If the inequality is violated, the switch deterministically forces `approved = False`, `iso_response_code = "51"`, and places a hold only if allowed by scheme rules.

---

### 4.3 Violation of Space-Time Kinematics (The 900 km/h Transit Velocity Limit)

In physical payment systems, Card-Present (CP) transactions require the physical cardholder and card plastic to be located at the physical Point of Sale (POS) terminal coordinates $(\text{lat}, \text{lon})$.

#### The Hypersonic Teleportation Pathology of DGMs
Because continuous latitude, longitude, and timestamps are generated as unconstrained numerical variables, deep generative models frequently emit:
- Transaction 1: Legitimate chip swipe in New York City ($40.7128^\circ\text{ N}, -74.0060^\circ\text{ W}$) at 14:00:00 UTC.
- Transaction 2: Legitimate chip swipe for the same card in London ($51.5074^\circ\text{ N}, -0.1278^\circ\text{ W}$) at 14:15:00 UTC.
- **Physical Reality:** The geodesic great-circle distance is $d \approx 5,570\text{ km}$. The elapsed time is $\Delta t = 900\text{ s} = 0.25\text{ hours}$. The implied transit velocity is:
  $$v = \frac{5,570\text{ km}}{0.25\text{ h}} = 22,280\text{ km/h} \quad (\approx \text{Mach } 18)$$
Unconstrained DGMs assign positive probability density to these hypersonic teleportations because their covariance matrices lack spatial-temporal kinematic bounds.

#### FraudxAI Architectural Defense: Antipodal-Safe Geodesic Kinematics
FraudxAI enforces strict kinematic verification via [`fraudx_synthesizer/invariants.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/invariants.py):
- **Antipodal-Safe Haversine Metric:** To prevent floating-point roundoff singularities on antipodal coordinates, FraudxAI clamps the spherical chord length:
  $$a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \lambda}{2}\right)$$
  $$a_{\text{clamped}} = \max(0.0, \min(1.0, a))$$
  $$d = 2 R \operatorname{atan2}\left(\sqrt{a_{\text{clamped}}}, \sqrt{1 - a_{\text{clamped}}}\right)$$
- **The 900 km/h Kinematic Ceiling:** For consecutive legitimate Card-Present transactions on the same account, the system asserts:
  $$v = \frac{d}{\Delta t / 3600.0} \le 900.0\text{ km/h}$$
  Commercial aviation operates at a maximum cruising velocity of $\sim 900\text{ km/h}$ (Mach 0.82). Any sequence exceeding this ceiling represents an unphysical state and is blocked by the simulation invariants.

### 4.4 Temporal Point Processes vs Fixed-Interval Sequential Models

#### The Failure of TimeGAN on Asynchronous Bursts
TimeGAN operates on discrete, regularly spaced time slices $\tau \in \{1, \dots, T\}$. In financial fraud, however:
- Legitimate consumer transactions occur as irregular, asynchronous point events driven by circadian rhythms (sleep/wake cycles, meal times, commute hours).
- Fraudulent attacks (e.g., automated carding bots, brute-force BIN enumeration, account takeover cash-outs) occur as **high-frequency, self-exciting transaction bursts** with inter-arrival times measured in milliseconds.
- Forcing asynchronous financial events into fixed time-step RNN/LSTM grids causes severe quantization errors, failing to model sub-second velocity attacks.

#### FraudxAI Architectural Defense: Hawkes Point Process Engine
FraudxAI models asynchronous transaction arrivals using a **Multivariate Hawkes Point Process Engine** ([`fraudx_synthesizer/hawkes.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/hawkes.py)):
$$\lambda(t) = \mu_0(t) + \sum_{t_i < t} \alpha e^{-\beta(t - t_i)}$$
where:
- $\mu_0(t)$ represents the cardholder's baseline circadian intensity function;
- $\alpha$ is the self-excitation branching ratio;
- $\beta$ is the exponential decay rate.
During an adversarial attack (e.g., Scenario 1: Micro-Auth Probing, or Scenario 5: Nocturnal Carding Burst), the attack intensity self-excites, creating realistic temporal clustering that accurately tests downstream real-time streaming feature stores.

### 4.5 Causal Invariance & The Lucas Critique: Why Observational DGMs Fail Under Policy Shifts

As demonstrated by Schölkopf et al. (2021) and Hardt et al. (2016), purely observational generative models learn correlations $P(X, Y)$, not causal mechanisms.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Observational DGM (CTGAN / TabDDPM)
        HistData["Historical Data P(X, Y) under Policy Pi_old"] --> TrainDGM["Train Generative Model"]
        TrainDGM --> SynthData["Synthetic Data under Pi_old"]
        PolicyShift["Bank Policy Shift: do(Policy = Strict 3DS)"] -.->|"FAILS (Lucas Critique)"| SynthData
    end
    subgraph FraudxAI Causal SCM
        SCM["Invertible SCM: X_i = f_i(PA_i, U_i)"] --> Intervene["Intervention: do(Policy = Strict 3DS)"]
        Intervene --> Counterfactuals["Exact Counterfactuals & Gaming Adaptation"]
        Counterfactuals --> GroundTruth["Analytical Ground-Truth Shapley Attributions"]
    end
```

- **The Lucas Critique in Fraud Detection:** Suppose an issuer changes its fraud mitigation strategy by requiring mandatory 3DS biometric challenges on all transactions over $100. In real life, fraudsters adapt (strategic classification): they reduce ticket sizes to $95 (smurfing) or migrate to alternative payment rails (e.g., gift cards or peer-to-peer transfers).
- **The Failure of DGMs:** A CTGAN or TabDDPM model trained on historical data will continue generating $150 fraudulent transactions without 3DS challenges, because it has no causal representation of agent incentives or institutional rules.
- **FraudxAI Invertible Structural Causal Models (SCMs):** FraudxAI implements an **Invertible SCM** ([`fraudx_synthesizer/causal_scm.py`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/fraudx_synthesizer/causal_scm.py)) with analytical Shapley efficiency guarantees:
  $$\sum_{i} \phi_i = \text{risk\_score} - \text{base\_risk}$$
  allowing risk engineers to execute exact $do(\text{intervention})$ queries, simulate multi-agent adversarial adaptation, and benchmark explainable AI (XAI) models against known ground-truth causal attributions.

| **Causal Counterfactuals & Shifts** | Fails (observational correlations only) | Fails (no structural equations) | Fixed heuristic branching | **Invertible DSCM with Analytical Shapley Proofs** |
| **Adversarial Adaptation** | Static | Static | Static rule sets | **Endogenous multi-agent feedback & 37 playbooks** |
| **Downstream XAI Ground Truth** | Unknown (black-box generator) | Unknown | Heuristic | **Mathematical (Axiomatic Shapley efficiency)** |

## 6. Synthesis & Strategic Recommendations

### 6.1 The Verdict on Discrete-Event Simulation vs Deep Generative Models
The debate between Discrete-Event Simulation and Deep Generative Models is often framed as a zero-sum contest between hand-engineered heuristics and automated neural representations. Our investigation reveals this dichotomy to be fundamentally flawed:
1. **Unconstrained DGMs cannot be trusted for mission-critical financial systems:** Because generative models operate in unconstrained Euclidean or latent spaces, they inevitably hallucinate states that violate international payment protocols, accounting identities, and physical kinematics. Benchmarking fraud detection or XAI systems on unconstrained DGM data trains models on unphysical artifacts.
2. **Pure heuristic rule engines lack expressive richness:** Traditional rule-based simulators (such as early PaySim) produce overly simplistic, predictable distributions that fail to stress-test modern graph neural networks or gradient-boosted trees.
3. **The Superiority of FraudxAI's Hybrid Architecture:** The optimal solution is the **decoupled architecture** pioneered by FraudxAI:
   - **Layer 2 (Generative Behavioral Layer):** Utilizes expressive multi-agent behavioral models, Hawkes point processes, and causal structural equations to propose candidate transaction intents;
   - **Layer 1 (Deterministic Institutional Rail):** Passes every candidate intent through an uncompromising, deterministic banking switch that enforces multi-party double-entry solvency, ISO 8583 protocol integrity, regulatory velocity ceilings, and $900\text{ km/h}$ geodesic kinematic limits.

### 6.2 Key Open Questions & Future Research Directions
1. **Differentiable Payment Rail Verifiers:** Can the deterministic rules of the `RailVerifierSwitch` be formulated as differentiable projection operators or constraint loss terms (e.g., via interior-point or Lagrangian methods), enabling TabDDPM or CTGAN to be trained directly within the manifold of valid banking transactions?
2. **Scaling to Cross-Border RTGS Liquidity Sinks:** Extending FraudxAI's discrete-event core to simulate multi-currency central bank real-time gross settlement (RTGS) networks, modeling liquidity hoarding during financial crises.
3. **Formal Verification of Synthetic Invariants:** Developing automated SAT/SMT solver verification suites to mathematically prove that no synthesized record within a 100-million transaction dataset violates banking protocol invariants.
