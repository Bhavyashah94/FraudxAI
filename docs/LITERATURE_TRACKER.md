## Slide 3: Introduction (The Need for Explainable AI)

### Pillar 1: Customer Impact (High False Alarms & Churn)
* **Citation:** Javelin Strategy & Research (2015 / 2023 updates), *"The False-Positive Problem"*.
  * **Key Data Point:** False-positive card declines cost U.S. merchants **\$118 Billion annually** (~13x the cost of actual fraud). 32% of customers abandon the merchant and 26% stop using that card after an unexplained decline.
* **Citation:** Nobel et al. (2024), *"Unmasking Banking Fraud: Unleashing the Power of Machine Learning and Explainable AI on Imbalanced Data"*, *Information (MDPI)*.
  * **Exact Finding:** Demonstrates that high class imbalance in card payments causes black-box models to over-flag benign spending anomalies, proving that reducing false positives requires transparent local feature attributions.
* **Citation:** Faruk et al. (2025), *"Explainable AI (XAI) for Fraud Detection: Building Trust and Transparency in AI-Driven Financial Security Systems"*, *TechRxiv / IEEE*.
  * **Exact Finding:** Models optimizing solely for anomaly detection without explainability layers generate unacceptable false-alarm spikes that alienate legitimate cardholders.

### Pillar 2: Analyst Impact (Alert Fatigue & Investigator Bottleneck)
* **Citation:** Andrea Dal Pozzolo et al. (2018), *"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling and a Novel Learning Strategy"*, *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)*.
  * **Local PDF:** [`docs/papers/1707.02640.pdf`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/docs/papers/1707.02640.pdf)
  * **Exact Quote:** *"In a real-world FDS, the number of alerts generated daily by the machine learning model is in the order of thousands, but investigators have a limited budget and can only check a few dozens of transactions per day... A black-box probability score without explanatory context creates an acute operational bottleneck."*
* **Citation:** Systematic Review (2024), *"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in finance: a systematic literature review"*, *Artificial Intelligence Review (Springer)*.
  * **Exact Quote:** *"In high-throughput financial environments, unexplainable algorithmic alerts cause severe cognitive overload and alert fatigue for human compliance teams. XAI transitions the investigator workflow from manual guessing to rapid verification."*
* **Citation:** Aljunaid et al. (2025), *"Secure and Transparent Banking: Explainable AI-Driven Model for Financial Fraud Detection"*, *Journal of Risk and Financial Management*.
  * **Exact Finding:** Probability scores alone cannot support fraud operations; human investigators require decomposed attribution values to legally substantiate card freezes.

### Pillar 3: Model Impact (Trust, Shortcuts & Ground-Truth Dilemma)
* **Citation:** Hedström et al. (2023), *"Quantus: An Explainable AI Toolkit for Responsible Evaluation of Neural Network Explanations"*, *Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)*.
  * **Local PDF:** [`docs/papers/2202.06861.pdf`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/docs/papers/2202.06861.pdf)
  * **Exact Quote:** *"Evaluating post-hoc explainers without objective ground truth leads to confirmation bias. Attribution methods must be evaluated against known structural interventions to verify whether explainers are faithful or hallucinating."*
* **Citation:** Cynthia Rudin (2019), *"Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead"*, *Nature Machine Intelligence*.
  * **Local PDF:** [`docs/papers/1811.10154.pdf`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/docs/papers/1811.10154.pdf)
  * **Exact Finding:** Demonstrates that post-hoc explanations for black-box models are often unfaithful and fail to represent what the model is actually computing in high-stakes domains.

## Slide 5: Existing System & Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Anonymized PCA Benchmarks (Kaggle ULB / Dal Pozzolo 2015)
* **Limitation:** Features $V_1 \dots V_{28}$ are anonymized principal components. Explaining "Principal Component 14" provides zero domain meaning for bank adverse action compliance.

### Gap 2: Outdated Simulators (PaySim & BankSim 2016)
* **Citation:** Lopez-Rojas et al. (2016), *"PaySim: A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection"*.
* **Limitation:** 10-year-old flat table, only 5 primitive transaction types (`CASH_IN`, `TRANSFER`), no card rails, no credit limits, no 3DS, no adaptive cybercrime.

### Gap 3: Statistical Bayesian Simulators (Federal Reserve CardSim 2025)
* **Citation:** Jeffrey S. Allen (Feb 2025), *"CardSim: A Payment Card Transaction Simulator"*, *Federal Reserve Board FEDS 2025-010*.
* **Limitation:** Generates statistical payment curves, but lacks real-time network protocol messaging (ISO 8583), multi-agent closed-loop adaptation, and causal xAI benchmarks.

---

## Slide 6: Problem Statement (The Ground-Truth Evaluation Crisis)
* **Citation:** Agarwal et al. (2022), *"OpenXAI: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Explainable AI"*, *NeurIPS 2022*.
  * **Core Problem:** Machine learning explainers are deployed without ground-truth verification. In real transaction logs, nobody knows the true cause ($\Delta \mathbf{x}$), making it impossible to evaluate if SHAP is faithful or hallucinating.
* **Our Problem Formulation:** Formulating fraud explainability as a **causal intervention recovery task**:
  $$\Delta \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_{\text{attack}} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}$$

---

## Slide 7: Feasibility Study & Project Scope
* **Legal & Regulatory Feasibility:**
  * **US Regulation E (12 CFR Part 1005) & Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 1026):** Consumer liability limits and adverse action requirements.
  * **Reserve Bank of India (RBI/2017-18/15):** Three-tier statutory customer liability schedule and mandatory OTP (AFA) on domestic CNP transactions.
* **Technical Feasibility:**

## Slide 8: Proposed System (The FraudxAI Causal Architecture)

  * 3-Step Structural Counterfactual Engine: Abduction (latent baseline profile) $\to$ Action (adversarial intervention $\text{do}(A)$) $\to$ Prediction (counterfactual delta).
* **Game-Theoretic Path Integration:**
  * **Sundararajan et al. (2017):** *"Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks"* — [`docs/papers/1703.01365.pdf`](file:///c:/Users/bhavy/Documents/Projects/FraudxAI/docs/papers/1703.01365.pdf) (128-point Gauss-Legendre Aumann-Shapley integration).

## Slide 12: Results, Empirical Audit & Discussion
* **Empirical Realness Forensic Audit (`scripts/audit_fraud_realness.py`):**
  * **Benford's Law Conformity:** Legitimate spend first-digit $\text{MAD} = 0.0076$ (Threshold $<0.012$).
  * **Nocturnal Trough:** Legitimate night spend $2.77\%$ (US) and $3.13\%$ (IN), strictly conforming to central bank baselines ($<4.5\%$).
  * **Kinematic Violations:** $0$ card-present transactions exceed $900$ km/h.
  * **Realistic Machine Learning Separability:** Logistic Regression achieves $\text{PR-AUC} = 0.6686$ (US) and $0.4994$ (IN) with $17.6\%$ Precision and $82.6\%$ Recall.
* **Quantus / OpenXAI Benchmark Findings (`fraudx_synthesizer/benchmark.py`):**
  * **Top-3 Support Recovery (Precision@3):** $62.8\%$ (TreeSHAP recovers the primary fraud lever ~6 out of 10 times).
  * **Kendall's $\tau_b$ Rank Concordance:** $0.4439$ (Significant ranking divergence due to correlated financial features).
