"""Tests for the pinned evaluation protocol and grade-stability reporting (spec/18 §4).

Why these assertions exist
--------------------------
Measured 2026-10-10 over eleven runs of `benchmark --unified`, identical except for
`--seed`, the same command reported between 4 and 9 violations: several gates rest on
small denominators (2-8 streaming test days; pillar-2 attack simulations whose macro
mean moves in steps of ~0.06), so a single run's violation count was not a result.
`spec/18` pinned thresholds but not the run they were applied to.

Everything asserted here is the fix for that, in three parts:

1. The protocol is *read from spec/18* rather than restated in code, so the pin and the
   SSOT cannot drift apart.
2. A run that deviates from it is identified and reported as OFF-PROTOCOL instead of
   emitting a grade that looks comparable.
3. The stability summary counts *gates*, not strings -- violation texts embed their own
   observed values, so naive grouping would count every run as a different failure.
