"""spec/07 section 19: the competing fraud stream follows the realised legitimate rate.

generate_batch paced the fraud stream to the planned span, but the legitimate stream runs
ahead of the plan (self-excitation and shopping trips), so a 1,000-row batch asked for
6 percent fraud delivered 3.3 percent and stopped on day 17 of 30.
