"""Automated verification suite for zero synthetic leaks, EMV chip primacy, and intervention recovery.

Verifies:
1. Zero synthetic IP distance zeros (no degenerate value and no low-end threshold that cleanly separates fraud from legitimate rows).
2. Hardware cryptographic primacy: Authentic EMV Chip+PIN transactions never receive ISO 59 false declines.
3. Attack script intervention support recovery: TreeSHAP achieves high Precision@3 against canonical attack interventions.
4. Anti-leak tripwires: PR-AUC remains realistic (<= 0.96) with no single feature holding >70% attribution.

def test_zero_synthetic_ip_distance_leak():
    """Asserts that zero synthetic zeros exist for ip_distance_from_home_km across all fraud playbooks.

    What this guards against
    ------------------------
    A degenerate value (0.0) or a low-end threshold that cleanly separates the two classes,
    either of which would let a trivial rule `ip_distance <= t` stand in for a fraud model.

    Why the previous thresholds were removed
    ----------------------------------------
    This test formerly asserted `min(fraud) >= 1.5 km` and, separately, that
    `ip_distance <= 0.5` captured zero frauds. Both were unsound, and both failed on the
    untouched baseline before any engine change:

      * baseline 6938da3, seeds 1..40, exact test parameters -- `min(fraud) >= 1.5` failed
        on 4/40 seeds (seeds 5, 24, 35, 40 at 1.03, 1.29, 0.47, 1.42 km);
      * the `<= 0.5` guard failed on 1/40 (seed 35 at 0.47 km), so the test contradicted
        itself on that seed.

    The reason is that the thresholds never described the specified generator:

      * spec/07 section 12 gives the legitimate cardholder's geolocation error as a
        *lognormal* for CNP channels, which is unbounded below. Measured legit minima are
        0.600 / 0.850 / 0.990 km at seeds 101 / 7 / 2024 -- i.e. the legitimate population
        itself routinely sits under the old 1.5 km floor.
      * spec/07 section 17 routes victim-device attacks (ADV_ATO_SILENT_BAKING with
        victim_device=true) through that same legitimate distribution, because an attacker
        operating from the victim's own device genuinely shares the victim's connection.

    Enforcing `min(fraud) >= 1.5` would therefore have manufactured the very leak this test
    exists to prevent: with legitimate rows reaching 0.6 km, raising the fraud floor to 1.5
    makes `ip_distance < 1.5 => legitimate` a perfect rule.

    The replacement invariants below are distributional rather than minima of an extreme
    statistic, and were validated to hold on 40/40 seeds with the pacing fix applied and
    20/20 seeds on the untouched baseline -- so they encode a property of the generator
    itself, not of any single code state.
