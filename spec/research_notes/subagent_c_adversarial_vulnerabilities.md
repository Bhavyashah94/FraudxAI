## 1. Underground Economics & Expiration Decay of Stolen Card Data

### 1.1 Market Pricing Stratification
*   **Track 2 Dumps (CP):** $15–$45 USD (no PIN); $80–$220 USD with verified 4-digit ATM PIN (harvested via pinhole cameras or keypad overlays). Requires $85–$150 hardware (MSR605 encoder + blank PVC).
*   **CVV / CVV2 Dumps (CNP):** $8–$30 USD per record (Magecart e-skimmers, phishing kits).
*   **"Fullz" (Complete Identity Dossiers):** PAN, Expiry, CVV, Name, DOB, SSN, Billing Address, Phone. Sells for $35–$120 USD (Standard/Classic) up to $150–$350+ USD (Visa Infinite, Amex Platinum, Corporate).
*   **Regional Multiplier:** US cards trade at a 60%–75% discount relative to EU/UK cards due to sheer supply and historic lack of mandatory 3DS/SCA.

### 1.2 The Expiration Half-Life Decay ($t_{1/2}$)
Stolen cards suffer two-phase exponential decay:
$$V(t) = V_0 \cdot \left[ 0.65 \exp\left(-\frac{\ln 2}{28.5\text{ h}} t\right) + 0.35 \exp\left(-\frac{\ln 2}{260.0\text{ h}} t\right) \right]$$
*   Fast decay: $t_{1/2} \approx 28.5\text{ hours}$ (active SMS alerts + bank anomaly detection).
*   Slow decay: $t_{1/2} \approx 10.8\text{ days}$ (unmonitored / passive accounts).
*   **The 1-to-2 Hour Forcing Function:** Darknet card shops offer a 1–2 hour replacement warranty window on dead cards (ISO 05/14/54), forcing fraudsters to test and monetize in high-velocity bursts immediately after purchase.

### 1.3 Irreversibility & Liquidation Hierarchy
| MCC & Channel | Target Asset | Ticket Size ($) | Liquidation Haircut | Non-Recoverability Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MCC 5947 / 5310** (Gift Cards) | Apple, Amazon, Vanilla Visa | $100–$500 | 20%–35% discount | Digital codes redeemed instantly into burner accounts or sold P2P; no physical goods to claw back. |
| **MCC 5732 / 5045** (Electronics) | iPhones, MacBooks, GPUs | $800–$2,500 | 10%–20% discount | Shipped to reshipping mules / BOPIS in-store pickup; physical goods cannot be remotely revoked. |
| **MCC 6051 / 6012** (Crypto / Quasi-Cash) | USDT, BTC, Monero | $250–$1,500 | 5%–12% discount | Blockchain immutability; irreversible once confirmed. Issuers counter with aggressive 3DS. |
| **MCC 4511 / 7011** (Airlines / Hotels) | Flight bookings, hotel suites | $1,200–$6,000 | 50%–60% discount | Rogue "travel agencies" charge clean customers cash, pay airlines with stolen cards; chargeback hits weeks later. |
| **MCC 5542** (AFD Diesel) | Bulk commercial fuel | $350–$1,500 | 45%–55% discount | Pumping into concealed auxiliary truck bladders (275–500 gal IBC totes); fuel consumed immediately. |

| Attack Playbook | Target Instruments | Vulnerable Personas | Exploited Plumbing / Flaw | Ticket Size ($) | Burst Velocity | Key ISO Codes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro-Auth Card Testing** | Subprime Credit, Classic, GPR Prepaid | C1 (Hourly), C3 (Young Adult) | AVS ZIP-only match (`Z`), PSD2 Art. 16 exemption ($<€30$), sub-$2 alert fatigue ($P(\text{flag}) \approx 0.78\%$) | $0.50–$1.99 | 15–50 auths/sec across rotating MIDs | `00` (Live), `05` (Dead), `14` (Invalid PAN) |

## 3. Adversarial State Machine & Dynamic Adaptation Logic

### 3.1 Dynamic Balance Discovery (Handling ISO 51: Insufficient Funds)
Adversaries execute **Geometric Bisection Search**:
*   Initial attempt: $A_0 = \$850.00$
*   If approved (`00`): Repeat $A_1 = \$850.00$ until decline.
*   If declined (`51` Insufficient Funds):
    $$A_{k+1} = \text{round}\left( \max\left( 0.50 \cdot A_k, \, \$25.00 \right), \, 2 \right)$$
    *   $A_0 = \$850.00 \to$ `51`
    *   $A_1 = \$425.00 \to$ `51`
    *   $A_2 = \$212.50 \to$ `00` (Approved)
    *   $A_3 = \$106.25 \to$ `00` (Approved)
    *   $A_4 = \$53.12 \to$ `51` (Exhausted). Card marked `EXHAUSTED` and purged.

### 3.2 Merchant Hopping (Handling 3DS Challenges)
*   On 3DS soft decline / step-up challenge (`0110` with 3DS redirect or Field 39 = `65`):
    *   Terminate session at current MID.
    *   Hop to pre-catalogued low-friction merchant (US domestic merchant below $100 without 3DS, or gaming platform utilizing PSD2 Article 18 TRA exemption).
    *   Retry within 45 seconds with $A \le \$30.00$ USD.

### 3.3 Terminal Failure & Purge Logic
*   `ISO 05` (Do Not Honor) / `ISO 59` (Suspected Fraud): Immediately mark PAN as `BURNED` and halt to preserve proxy IP and browser fingerprints.
*   `ISO 14` (Invalid Card Number): Discard immediately.
*   `ISO 61` (Exceeds Limit) / `ISO 65` (Exceeds Activity Count): Move card to `COOL_OFF` queue and sleep for exactly **24.5 hours** until issuer rolling counters reset.
