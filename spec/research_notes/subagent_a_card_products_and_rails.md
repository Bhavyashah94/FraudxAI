## 2. Payment Rail Plumbing & Protocol Mechanics

### 2.1 Dual-Message System (DMS) vs Single-Message System (SMS)
*   **Dual-Message (Visa Base I/II, Mastercard Banknet/IPM):**
    *   *Real-time (T=0):* 0100 Auth Request $\to$ 0110 Auth Response (`00` Approved, `05` Do Not Honor, `51` Insufficient Funds). Places pending memo-hold on cardholder ledger.
    *   *Clearing & Presentment (T+1 to T+3 business days):* Merchant batch close generates Base II TC05 or Mastercard IPM clearing files matching original auth via RRN (DE 37), STAN (DE 11), Auth Code (DE 38), and TID.
    *   *Hold Expiry:* Auto-drops at 7 calendar days (retail) or 30 days (lodging/car rental). Late clearing posts anyway, causing unexpected overdrafts.
*   **Single-Message (EFT PIN Debit / ATM):**
    *   0200 Financial Transaction Request Inline. Real-time ledger debit at T=0. Zero hold lag.

### 2.2 Pre-Authorization Holds & Clearing Variance
*   **Automated Fuel Dispensers (AFD - MCC 5542):**
    *   Modern standard hold: **$175.00 USD** (fleet: $350.00).
    *   Mandatory partial authorization (Field 39 = `10`): If card has only $42 available, approves $42, and dispenser motor halts pump at delivered fuel value of $42.00. Final presentment clears exact pumped volume.
*   **Lodging (MCC 7011) & Car Rental (MCC 7512):**
    *   Hold formula: $(\text{Room} + \text{Tax}) \times \text{Nights} + (\$50\text{--}\$100 \times \text{Nights})$. Hold persists up to 30 calendar days.
*   **Dining & Restaurants (MCC 5812 / 5813):**
    *   **20% Tip Tolerance Window:** Acquirers may clear up to 120% of authorized check without secondary authorization. If settlement exceeds 120% without incremental auth, cardholder bank has immediate chargeback rights (Visa Reason 13.1 / Mastercard 4837).

### 2.3 Stand-In Processing (STIP)
*   **Trigger:** Issuer host timeout (>2.000 to 2.500 seconds SLA) or link failure. Network switch immediately engages STIP.
*   **STIP Floor Limits:** Standard: $100–$250; Gold/Signature: $500–$1,000; Ultra-Premium/Corporate: $2,500.
*   **Controls:** Negative Card File (NCF) exception hotlist check, Positive Balance File (PBF) check, max 2–3 consecutive offline approvals per outage window. 4th consecutive attempt is hard-declined (`05`).
*   **Signaling:** Field 39 = `00`, Field 44.5 (Visa) or Field 48.22 (Mastercard) indicates network STIP approval. Issuer is contractually liable.

### 2.4 Address Verification Service (AVS) Response Matrix
*   Extracts numeric characters from street address + 5/9 digit postal code:
    *   `Y`: Full match (street & 5-digit zip).
    *   `A`: Street matches, zip does not.
    *   `Z`: 5-digit zip matches, street does not (Primary bypass for gas pumps & digital micro-merchants using whitepages lookups).
    *   `N`: Neither matches (High fraud indicator).
    *   `U` / `G`: International issuer non-participating (Merchant dilemma: decline 80% legitimate foreign buyers or accept 100% fraud chargeback liability).

### 2.5 EMV 3-D Secure 2.x & PSD2 RTS Exemptions (Regulation (EU) 2018/389)
*   **Article 16 (Low Value):** $\le €30$ EUR remote transactions. Reset circuit-breaker: SCA mandated if cumulative non-SCA spend $>€100$ EUR or consecutive non-SCA count $>5$ transactions.
*   **Article 18 (Transaction Risk Analysis - TRA):**
    *   $\le €100$ EUR: PSP fraud rate $\le 0.13\%$ (13 bps).
    *   $€100.01\text{--}€250$ EUR: PSP fraud rate $\le 0.06\%$ (6 bps).
    *   $€250.01\text{--}€500$ EUR: PSP fraud rate $\le 0.01\%$ (1 bp).
    *   $>€500$ EUR: **Strictly forbidden.** SCA is legally mandatory.
*   **Article 13 (Trusted Beneficiary / Whitelisting):** Exempt once cardholder adds merchant during SCA challenge.
*   **Article 14 (Recurring / Subscriptions):** Fixed-amount series exempt after initial CIT setup.
